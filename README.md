# MasterThesis: Developing Flexible and Scalable Games using Data-Oriented Design in Comparison to Object-Oriented Design

Since the 1970s, game development has undergone significant evolution and
growth in popularity. This has increased user expectations leading to rapidly
increased software complexity and higher demand for the hardware platforms.
Balancing appealing games with flexibility and scalability has become a major
challenge in the industry. For a long time, Object-Oriented Design (OOD) has
been the dominant design paradigm, valued for its flexibility and real-world reflection.
However, OOD is now facing scalability issues due to the increasing
player demands, requiring more processing of data. In response, Data-Oriented
Design (DOD) has emerged as a promising alternative that has gained more
attention from developers over the last decade. By focusing on the separation
of data and transformations, DOD provides an alternative design approach that
leverages modern computer architecture for cache-friendly data layouts, parallelism,
and optimized memory access patterns. This maximizes performance
and encourages greater flexibility by decoupling the game logic.

This thesis explores the benefits and challenges associated with DOD in game
development, specifically in terms of flexibility and scalability. Through interviews
with industry experts and a conducted case study, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of applying DOD in game development. The results show that both
OOD and DOD have challenges in terms of flexibility, specifically both implementations
showed a tendency to develop low cohesion and maintainability as
more complex features were added. However, DOD promoted greater decoupling
between the game features, enabling developers to make modifications
more efficiently. Additionally, DOD has proven to provide significant scalability
benefits compared to OOD. As the performance gap between CPU and memory
is expected to persist, the scalability benefits of DOD are expected to only get
more relevant in the field of game development.
